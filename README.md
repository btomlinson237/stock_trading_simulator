# Bobby's Stock Trading Simulator

For this project, I utilized HTML5, CSS3, SQL, Bootstrap, jQuery, Python, Flask (Python microframework), and the Yahoo Finance API

This project functions as a more simplistic form of a stock website, and makes use of a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

Some of the features of this app include:

- User registration and user login.

- The buying and selling of stocks using fake currency (like paper trading; users start with "$10,000")

- Retrieve current share price (real-time market data provided by Yahoo Finance)

- View transaction history (shares bought/ sold)
